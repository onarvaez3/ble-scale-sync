## v1.6.2 <Badge type="tip" text="latest" /> {#v1-6-2}

_2026-03-02_

### Changed
- **CI**: Docker `latest` tag now only applies to GitHub releases, not every push to main ([#70](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/pull/70))
- **CI**: Removed push-to-main Docker build trigger ([#71](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/pull/71))
- **Docs**: SEO meta keywords added to all documentation pages ([#69](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/pull/69))

## v1.6.1 {#v1-6-1}

_2026-03-01_

### Fixed
- **BlueZ stale discovery recovery** after Docker container restart. Adds kernel-level adapter reset via `btmgmt` as Tier 4 fallback when D-Bus recovery fails, plus proactive adapter reset in Docker entrypoint ([#39](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/issues/39), [#43](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/pull/43))

### Changed

- **Docs**: Contributors section added to README
- **Node.js**: minimum version bumped to 20.19.0 (required by eslint 10.0.2)
- **Deps**: @stoprocent/noble 2.3.16, eslint 10.0.2, typescript-eslint 8.56.1, @types/node 25.3.3, @inquirer/prompts 8.3.0

## v1.6.0 {#v1-6-0}

_2026-02-28_

### Added
- **ESP32 BLE proxy** (experimental) for remote BLE scanning over MQTT. Use a cheap ESP32 board (~8€) as a wireless Bluetooth radio, enabling BLE Scale Sync on machines without local Bluetooth. Supports both broadcast and GATT scales
- **ESP32 display board** (Guition ESP32-S3-4848S040) with LVGL UI showing scan status, user matches, and export results
- **Beep feedback** on ESP32 boards with I2S buzzer (Atom Echo) when a known scale is detected
- **Streaming BLE scan** for ESP32-S3 boards with hardware radio coexistence
- **Docker mqtt-proxy compose** (`docker-compose.mqtt-proxy.yml`) requiring no BlueZ, D-Bus, or `NET_ADMIN`
- Setup wizard includes interactive mqtt-proxy configuration
- `BLE_HANDLER=mqtt-proxy` environment variable as alternative to config.yaml
- ESP32 proxy documentation page with architecture diagram, flashing guide, and MQTT topics reference

### Changed
- Renpho broadcast parsing consolidated into QN scale adapter
- Landing page updated with ESP32 proxy and Setup Wizard feature cards

### Thanks
- [@APIUM](https://github.com/APIUM) for the ESP32 MQTT proxy implementation ([#45](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/pull/45))

## v1.5.0 {#v1-5-0}

_2026-02-24_

### Added
- **File exporter** (CSV/JSONL) for local measurement logging without external services. Auto-header CSV with proper escaping, JSONL one-object-per-line, per-user file paths, and directory writability healthcheck
- **Strava exporter** with OAuth2 token management. Updates athlete weight via PUT /api/v3/athlete. Automatic token refresh, restricted file permissions (0o600), and interactive setup script (`npm run setup-strava`)
- Strava API application setup guide in documentation with step-by-step instructions

## v1.4.0 {#v1-4-0}

_2026-02-24_

### Added
- **BLE diagnostic tool** (`npm run diagnose`) for detailed device analysis: advertisement data, service UUIDs, RSSI, connectable flag, and step-by-step GATT connection testing
- **Broadcast mode** for non-connectable QN-protocol scales (#34). Reads weight directly from BLE advertisement data without requiring a GATT connection
- **Garmin 2FA/MFA support** in `setup_garmin.py` ([#41](https://github.com/KristianP26/ble-scale-sync/pull/41) by [@APIUM](https://github.com/APIUM))

### Fixed
- **QN broadcast parser**: corrected byte layout (LE uint16 at bytes 17-18, stability flag at byte 15)
- **ES-CS20M**: service UUID 0x1A10 fallback for unnamed Yunmai-protocol devices (#34)
- **ES-CS20M**: 0x11 STOP frame support as stability signal (#34)

### Changed
- **CI**: Node.js 24 added to test matrix (required check)
- **CI**: PR-triggered Docker image builds with `pr-{id}` tags (#44)
- **Deps**: ESLint v10, typescript-eslint v8.56

## v1.3.1 {#v1-3-1}

_2026-02-22_

### Fixed

_2026-02-16_

### Added
- **Garmin multi-user Docker authentication** - `setup-garmin --user <name>` and `--all-users` commands
- `setup_garmin.py --from-config` mode reads users and credentials from `config.yaml`
- `--token-dir` argument for per-user token directories (persisted via Docker volumes)
- `pyyaml` dependency for config.yaml parsing in Python scripts
- Docker multi-user volume examples in `docker-compose.example.yml` and docs

### Fixed
- Friendly error message when D-Bus socket is not accessible in Docker instead of raw `ENOENT` crash (#25)

- **Multi-user support** — weight-based user matching (4-tier priority)
- Per-user exporters (override global for specific users)
- `config.yaml` as primary configuration format (`.env` fallback preserved)
- Automatic `last_known_weight` tracking (debounced, atomic YAML writes)
